Bug report 

publish in the GitHub
write in MarkDown 
In real life, I would use a bug tracking system such as Jira.

includes details such as the steps necessary to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the observed behavior. an accurate description of the problem, steps taken to reproduce it, expected results, actual results, screenshots or video recordings, if applicable, device configuration, and other relevant data.
The primary purpose of a bug report is to provide an accurate description of the problem to the development team to facilitate its resolution.
